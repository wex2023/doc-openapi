    #### Signature Parameters Description


    Since WEX provides open APIs to third-party platforms, data security must be ensured - for example, preventing data tampering, avoiding outdated data, blocking duplicate submissions, and controlling request frequency. Among these, **data integrity verification** is the most crucial aspect.


    #### Signature Parameters


    1. **validate-appkey** - Public key obtained after applying for the API Key

    2. **validate-timestamp** - Request timestamp in milliseconds (Unix time). Request validity is determined based on this value and `validate-recvwindow`

    3. **validate-signature** - Some API requests require a signature. See details in the Obtain Signature section.

    4. **validate-recvwindow** - Defines the validity period of a request. Default is 5 seconds; maximum is 60 seconds. If the timestamp is more than 5000ms earlier than server time, the request is invalid. If the client timestamp is more than 1 second ahead of server time, the request will also be rejected. It is not recommended to exceed 5 seconds.

    5. **validate-algorithms** - Signature is generated using an HSC-based algorithm. Default: HmacSHA256. Supported: HmacMD5, HmacSHA1, HmacSHA224, HmacSHA256, HmacSHA384, HmacSHA512
